Parent Called (original answer)

___________
Wrong - child was called first. Why?

Updated answer: The child class is called first because the method c.doSomething()
takes on the one of the object type, not the variable type?



public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
    c.doSomething();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
//Overrides parent doSomething method
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }

  public void doSomethingElse(){
      System.err.println("Child called something else");
  }
}
