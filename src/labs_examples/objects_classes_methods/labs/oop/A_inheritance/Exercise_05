Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?

Parent called
Child called

Because all that we do is create the object, which calls both default constructors of the Parent and Child classes.
The variable type (Parent) is called first and then the object type (Child)


public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
